# ðŸš€ Container Package Cleanup Action

This **Container Package Cleanup** GitHub Action automates the cleanup of old Docker images (or other container packages) in a GitHub repository or organization based on specified criteria.

---

## Features

- Deletes old container package versions based on a threshold date.
- Supports filtering by included and excluded tags.
- Allows configuration through inputs or a configuration file.
- Provides debug mode for detailed logging.
- Supports dry-run mode to preview deletions without making changes.
- **Supports wildcard-based tag matching** for flexible filtering.

## ðŸ“Œ Outputs

This action does not produce any outputs. It performs cleanup operations directly on the container packages.

## ðŸ“Œ Environment Variables

| Name            | Description                                      | Required |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | -------- |
| `PACKAGE_TOKEN` | GitHub token with permissions to manage packages | Yes      |

> **Note:** The `PACKAGE_TOKEN` must have the following permissions:
> - **`read:packages`**: To list and retrieve package information.
> - **`delete:packages`**: To delete package versions.

## ðŸ“Œ Usage Example

Below is an example of how to use this action in a GitHub Actions workflow:

```yaml
name: Cleanup Old Docker Images

on:
  schedule:
    - cron: "0 0 * * 0" # Runs weekly on Sunday at midnight
  workflow_dispatch:
    inputs:
      threshold-days:
        description: "Number of days to keep container versions"
        required: false
        default: "7"
      included-tags:
        description: "Tags to include for deletion"
        required: false
        default: ""
      excluded-tags:
        description: "Tags to exclude from deletion"
        required: false
        default: "release*"
      dry-run:
        description: "Enable dry-run mode"
        required: false
        default: "false"

jobs:
  cleanup:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Run Container Package Cleanup Action
        uses: netcracker/qubership-workflow-hub/actions/container-package-cleanup@main
        with:
          threshold-days: ${{ github.event.inputs.threshold-days }}
          included-tags: ${{ github.event.inputs.included-tags }}
          excluded-tags: ${{ github.event.inputs.excluded-tags }}
          debug: ${{ github.event.inputs.debug }}
          dry-run: ${{ github.event.inputs.dry-run }}
        env:
          PACKAGE_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.PACKAGE_TOKEN }}
```

## Additional Information

### Wildcard Matching Behavior

The `wildcardMatch` function is used to match tags against patterns with wildcards (`*`). This allows for flexible filtering of tags during the cleanup process.

#### Supported Wildcard Patterns

1. **Exact Match**:
   - If the pattern does not contain a `*`, the function checks for an exact match.
   - Example:
     - Tag: `release`
     - Pattern: `release`
     - Result: Match

2. **Prefix Match**:
   - If the pattern ends with `*`, the function checks if the tag starts with the prefix.
   - Example:
     - Tag: `release-v1`
     - Pattern: `release*`
     - Result: Match

3. **Suffix Match**:
   - If the pattern starts with `*`, the function checks if the tag ends with the suffix.
   - Example:
     - Tag: `v1-release`
     - Pattern: `*release`
     - Result: Match

4. **Substring Match**:
   - If the pattern starts and ends with `*`, the function checks if the tag contains the substring.
   - Example:
     - Tag: `v1-release-candidate`
     - Pattern: `*release*`
     - Result: Match

5. **Regex-like Match**:
   - If the pattern contains `*` in the middle, the function treats it as a wildcard for any characters.
   - Example:
     - Tag: `release-v1`
     - Pattern: `release*v1`
     - Result: Match

#### Example Usage of `wildcardMatch`

```javascript
wildcardMatch("release-v1", "release*"); // true
wildcardMatch("v1-release", "*release"); // true
wildcardMatch("v1-release-candidate", "*release*"); // true
wildcardMatch("release-v1", "release-v2"); // false
```

### Debug Mode

When `debug` is set to `true`, the action logs detailed information, including:

- The calculated threshold date.
- The list of excluded and included tags.
- The list of packages and their versions retrieved from the repository or organization.
- The versions that are selected for deletion after applying the filtering criteria.

This mode is useful for troubleshooting and understanding how the action processes packages and versions.

---

### Dry-Run Mode

When `dry-run` is set to `true`, the action will simulate the cleanup process without actually deleting any package versions. It will log the versions that would be deleted if the action were run without `dry-run`.

This mode is useful for previewing the cleanup results and ensuring the filtering criteria are correct before making changes.

---

### Priority of Tag Filtering

1. **Excluded Tags**:
   - Versions with tags matching `excluded-tags` are **always skipped**, even if they match `included-tags`.
2. **Included Tags**:
   - If specified, only versions with tags matching `included-tags` are considered for deletion.
3. **Default Behavior**:
   - If `included-tags` is empty, all versions (except those excluded) are considered for deletion.

---

### Tag Matching Behavior

- **Exact Match**: If a tag is specified without a wildcard (e.g., `release`), the action will look for an exact match. Only versions with the tag `release` will be included or excluded.
- **Wildcard Match**: If a tag is specified with a wildcard (e.g., `release*`), the action will look for partial matches. For example, `release*` will match tags like `release`, `release-v1`, or `release-candidate`.

This allows for flexible filtering based on your tagging strategy.
